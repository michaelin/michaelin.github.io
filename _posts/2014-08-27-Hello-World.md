There. That wasn't too bad. With a little help from [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) I'm up and running with a simple blog.

Many people say that the best way to learn something is to teach it, so my intention is to do just that. There are several technologies that I intend to have a closer look at, including:

* [Packer](http://www.packer.io/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/), [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/), [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) and [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/community/)

Stay tuned for the first installment.
